# Most-Starred-Projects-on-GitHub (16.11.2022)
A program for automatic downloading information about GitHub projects with the largest number of stars + building it's visualization. Using GitHub API.
It consists of two subprograms.

The first subprogram shows text information about most-starred projects (name of the project and its owner, repository link, stars number and description).
The information files located in 'Repositories' folder (langname_repos.py). Watch any language you are interested in.

The second subprogram takes info about most-starred projects and outputs as a diagram with repository name and stars number. When run, the information is saved to HTML file.
The visualization files located in 'Repositories_visual' folder (langname_repos_visual.py). Watch any language you are interested in.

I take only program languages in this repository and don't include frameworks and markup languages (there are actually many program languages).
The list is being updated!
